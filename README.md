# Logzilla

Logzilla is a tiny tool for collecting and analyzing logs from various sources.
It works by defining a set of log sources and processing rules to extract and analyze the data.
It consists of 4 components:

- **Log Source:** A source of logs that Logzilla can collect. This can be any source such as a file, a network socket, or a redis database.
- **Processor:** A processor processes raw logs and extracts information. You can use built-in processors such as JSON, raw text, or you can write your own using regex or lua.
- **Querier:** Querier - as the name suggests - is used to search inside information extracted from logs.
- **UI:** A web-based user interface that allows users to interact with Logzilla.
